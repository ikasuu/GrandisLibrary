  <hr />
  Scrolls are one way of upgrading equipment, they are found in the USE tab. Scrolls are the traditional way of upgrading equipment and can be done by double-clicking it and dragging it on to an item. Most of regular scrolls nowadays are
  useless and have been replaced with an easier system called <a style={{color: '#03afe7'}} href="https://support-maplestory.nexon.net/hc/en-us/articles/204744535-What-are-Spell-Traces-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spell Tracing</a> which
  will be explained later. For now, Spell Tracing provides the same function as scrolling and is much easier to obtain than scrolls
  <strong>[Note]: </strong>Whenever you use a scroll, whether it fails or passes, an upgrade slot will be consumed
  <strong>[Note]: </strong>Scrolls and upgrade slots are used only on non-Reboot servers. Reboot servers only have star forcing/enhancing

  <strong>Regular Scrolls]: </strong>When a regular scroll succeeds, it will increase the stats of equipment by a flat amount

  <a style={{color: '#03afe7'}} href="http://maplestory.nexon.net/game/marvel-machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel Machine</a>, etc. (aka loot boxes) that provide better stats than Spell Tracing and regular scrolls. Keep in mind these
  are very expensive and are usually used late game to maximize damage. As well, the best scrolls most of the time also have bad success rates and may destroy items so, they may cost extra to buy items that prevent items from being destroyed
  or losing an upgrade slot

  Spell tracing involves using an item called <img src="https://maplestory.io/api/GMS/210.1.1/item/2433943/icon" />
  <a style={{color: '#03afe7'}} href="https://maplestory.wiki/GMS/210.1.1/item/4001832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Spell Trace"</a> to upgrade items instead of using scrolls. They also consume an upgrade slot upon success or fail. This is
  the main and most common way to upgrade equipment. Some common ways to get Spell Traces is to hunt monsters, Pollo Frito portals, Silent Crusade, Surprise Missions and from events
  <img className="alignnone size-full wp-image-1078" src="https://grandislibrary.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/maplestory_r3uzuwnhrk.png" alt="MapleStory_r3uZUwnhrk" width={341} height={293} />

  You can open the Equipment Enchant menu by either pressing "O" by default or through your inventory by pressing the <strong>red button with a hammer</strong>

  Once you have opened the menu, you can drag a piece of equipment into it and start spell tracing. Spell tracing consumes a certain amount of spell traces to upgrade equipment. There are different scrolls to choose from, for weapons most of
  the time you just use the 70% ones and 15% if you have the resources and plan to keep it for a while For regular gear, you can upgrade them using 70% and 30% if you have the resources and plan to keep it for a while
  <strong>Note: The lower the success rate, the higher the stats they provide but also costs more Spell Traces! As well, the higher level gear will cost more Spell Traces</strong>

  Once you have consumed all upgrade slots, you may star force/enhance your gear. In Reboot, there are no upgrade slots, so you just star force/enhance instead. Star Forcing costs mesos that grants increased stats on success.

  Like before, you can drag equipment into the Equipment Enchant UI like spell tracing to star force your gear
  <img src="https://support-maplestory.nexon.net/hc/article_attachments/360057676612/stop.png" alt="stop.png" /><img src="https://support-maplestory.nexon.net/hc/article_attachments/360057832451/successenchant.png" alt="successenchant.png" />
  Once you press "Enhance", a window/mini game will pop up, you will need to press "Stop" in the middle to increase your success rate by a VERY small amount. You can disable the mini game by pressing "Disable Star Catching". Another button
  you see is "Safeguard" which protects your item from being destroyed but increases the cost significantly Higher level equipment will have more available stars/enhancements but they are also more expensive to enhance but they provide more
  stats the more you enhance it. The optimal amount of stars you want for each piece of equipment is 10-12 stars early game
  <h3><strong>Star Force Outcomes</strong></h3>
  There are four possible outcomes when Star Forcing. The success and failure rates scale with the current Star Force level of the equipment
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Success</strong></td>
        <td>Increase Star Force level by 1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Failure (Keep)</strong></td>
        <td>No change to Star Force level</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Failure (Drop)</strong></td>
        <td>Decrease Star Force level by 1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Failure (Destroy) </strong></td>
        <td>Destroy equipment and create Equipment Trace</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <br />
  If two Star Force attempts in a row result in failure, the next attempt will enter Chance Time and have a guaranteed success rate. Additionally, once a piece of equipment reaches 10, 15 and 20 Star Force respectively, they will not drop
  below that Star Force even if the attempt fails If the equipment is destroyed while Star Forcing, you will gain an Equipment Trace. Equipment Traces can be applied to a new copy of the same item to restore all the stats, potentials and
  enhancements
  <strong>[Star Force Maps]</strong> There are special training maps that will require you to have a certain amount of Star Force to hunt efficiently on a map. These maps feature monsters with greater health but give much more EXP Star Force
  also contributes to the amount of damage your Legion Character does on the Legion Board

  <h2 id="hammer">Transfer Hammer</h2>
  <hr />
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/W6T3Q8C.png" />
  <p>
    Transfer Hammer is a system that allows you to transfer Star Force, Potentials, Bonus Potentials, and Soul Weapon from one equipment to another (with restrictions). The following will not be transferred, Scrolled Stats and Additional
    Stats. Additionally you will lose one Star Force while transferring and any potentials above Epic will be dropped down to Epic Potential. You can only transfer equipment up to 10 levels apart of each other. For equipment below Lv. 100,
    you can transfer up to 20 levels apart
  </p>
  <p>
    Some requirements for Transfer Hammering is that the piece of equipment must have at least 1 Star Force, cannot be Superior Gear (such as Tyrants) and must be the same equipment type (regardless of job group). Overalls can be counted
    towards both as a top or bottom and vice versa
  </p>
  <p>
    In regular servers, any remaining upgrade slots will be filled by 100% Spell Traces for free. You can choose which stat you want the upgrades to be. I recommend that you already Upgrade/Spell Trace the Transferring Item first if you do
    not want the 100% Spell Trace stats
  </p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9Dh4n89.png" />
  To begin Transfer Hammering, you can access the UI from your Inventory by<strong> pressing the blue hammer icon</strong>

  Tranposing allows you to transfer an equipment's bonus stats from Additional Stats, Scroll and Star Force Enhancements (the blue and green stats) to <strong>Sweetwater gear</strong>. The Star Force count will also drop by 1 but you retain
  the bonus stats. Potential Ranks also carry over but the Potential Lines will be reset Transposing is unlocked after gaining access to Commerci at Lv. 140. Transposing will cost

  Cubing refers to using Cubes that will reroll the Potential of an item. Cubes may tier up your equipment's Potential to the next rank, up to what that cube will allow. Equipment can also have Bonus Potentials as well that add upon your
  regular Potentials To start Cubing, double-click on a Cube in your inventory (USE or CASH tab) and then drag the Cube onto the piece of Equipment you want to reroll
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/uaD0QPP.png" />
  You can reveal a piece of equipment's Potential by pressing the <strong>blue button with a magnifying glass </strong>

  <h2 id="additionalstats">Flames &amp; Additional Stats</h2>
  <hr />
  Equipment can come with additional stats. The stats can be categorized into Tiers. There are a total of 7 tiers with 7 being the highest and providing the most stat boosts. Boss Equipment &amp; KMS equipment tends to have higher tiers of
  additional stats compared to items outside of KMS (for example Gollux accessories &amp; Sweetwater). More info can be found at the bottom of the page on Additional Stats To reroll Additional Stats, you need to use items called "Rebirth Flames".
  Regular rebirth flames that have a "LV. X" attached to it can only reroll certain items up to that specified level and are dropped by Bosses. These regular flames yield lower tiers compared to special ones. You can identify which equipment
  can be flamed by hovering over them and checking the top left corner of the equipment icon. If there is a transparent dot, it can be flamed with regular rebirth flames. If there is a white dot, it can only be flamed with special rebirth
  flames
